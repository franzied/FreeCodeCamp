                Hamilton Naki (26 June 1926 – 29 May 2005) was a laboratory assistant to cardiac surgeon <a href="https://tinyurl.com/h7ykyfo" target="_blank">Christiaan Barnard</a> in South Africa.He was recognised for his surgical skills and for his ability to teach medical students and physicians such skills despite not having received a formal medical education, and took a leading role in organ transplant research on animals.

            <h2 id="naki-contri">Naki's contributions</h2>
            <p class="contribute">His contributions at this time were described as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rosemary Hickman, transplantation surgeon whom Naki assisted and taught in the laboratory, and who worked with Naki for nearly 30 years: "Despite his limited conventional education, he had an amazing ability to learn anatomical names and recognize anomalies. His skills ranged from assisting to operating and he frequently prepared the donor animal (sometimes single-handedly) while another team worked on the recipient."</li>
                <li>Del Khan, head of Groote Schuur Hospital's organ transplant unit, whom Naki taught in the laboratory: "A liver transplant on a pig in the U.S. would involve a team of two or three medically qualified surgeons… Hamilton can do this all on his own."</li>
                <li>Ralph Kirsch, head of the Liver Research Centre at the University of Cape Town: “He was one of those remarkable men who really come around once in a long time. As a man without any education, he mastered surgical techniques at the highest level and passed them on to young doctors."</li>
                <li>Barnard: "A liver transplant is much more difficult than a heart transplant… [doctors who work with Naki] tell me that Hamilton can do all the various aspects of liver transplantation, which I can't do. So technically, he is a better surgeon than I am."</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Naki retired in 1991 afterwhich he received "a gardener's pension: 760 rand, or about $275, a month.</p>
